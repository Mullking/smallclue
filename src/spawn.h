/* Spawning a child, without assuming fork() exists.
 *
 * The applets here all used the same idiom: fork(), and in the child exec()
 * (sometimes several candidates in turn), report failure, _exit(127). That is
 * fine wherever fork() is available, but it cannot be implemented at all on a
 * platform that gives the whole program a single process -- iSH-AOK compiles
 * smallclue in as host code inside one app process, so a child has to become a
 * real guest task instead, and there is no way for fork() to return twice into
 * C code that is not being duplicated.
 *
 * Expressing the idiom as "spawn a child running one of these argv vectors"
 * keeps the ordinary POSIX build byte-identical in behaviour while giving such
 * a platform a single function to implement.
 *
 * Callers keep their own waitpid()/kill() logic: this only replaces the
 * fork-and-exec half, because timeout(1) needs the pid to signal and init
 * needs it to reap.
